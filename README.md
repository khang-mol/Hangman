# Hangman

## A functional project written in JavaScript featuring the game Hangman.

While functional, this project is still in the works as my first ever (non-one-tutorial based) project. The currently offered features are the following:

* Playing Hangman (duh)
* light / dark mode

## Demo

Will be posted if my project gains any substance.

## How to install this JavaScript project

Just the usual method.
```bash
git clone <url>
```

The file in question is called "index.html". I will link the playable website after I'm somewhat satisfied with the product.

## How to tweak this project for your own uses?

If you have more than 1 month of experience as a programmer, then this is not for you.

## Contributing

Since this is purely to learn JavaScript for myself, just telling me what part of my code is trash and should be improved on would help me more than enough.

## Features to work on
